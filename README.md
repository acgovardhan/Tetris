# Tetris in C

A simple Tetris game built from scratch in C, inspired by the movie *Tetris (2023)*.

## 🚀 About the Project
I was fascinated by how a regular government employee in the Soviet Union created the legendary Tetris in 1984 using Pascal. That story inspired me to take on the challenge of building my own version using C. After days of sketching and iterating, I finally built Tetris from scratch.
